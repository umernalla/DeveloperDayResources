# Refinitiv Developer Day Resources

Here you will find resources including code samples from the presentations for our Refinitiv EMEA Developer Day Series.

2) Our New Refinitiv Data Platform Library

  As part of our recent Refinitiv Developer Days Series, I spent the last few months travelling around Europe giving members    of our developer community a sneak peek at our exciting new Refinitiv Data Platform Library.

  The feedback was so positive, I felt it was only right to share this with our wider community - showcasing some of the key   features which will make the Refinitiv Data Platform Library such a useful addition to our current set of APIs. You can     read my full articvle here: https://developers.refinitiv.com/article/discover-our-upcoming-refinitiv-data-platform-library-part-1

  So, what is the Refinitiv Data Platform Library?

  Before we begin, I need to point out that the Refinitiv Data Platform Library is in Alpha mode and was released as part of   an Early Access Programme in the first weeks of January 2020. If you want to be part of the EAP, please reach out to your   Refinitiv account representative for a Refinitiv Data Platform trial account.

  UPDATE January 2020:

  An alpha version 1.0.0.a0 of the Python library is now available on PyPi - install by executing 'pip install refinitiv-     dataplatform' - in your Python environment

  Likewise, the .NET version can be found on NuGet - base package and Content Layer - with installation instructions on the   relevant pages.

  You can also find sample code on GitHub in .NET and Python flavours.

3) New Eikon Streaming Library

  To run the Eikon Data API Samples - you will need access to the newest 1.1.2 Eikon Python library which is just released     into EAP. You can find detail on where to get this new package, how to install it and code samples from:                     https://developers.refinitiv.com/eikon-apis/eikon-data-api/learning?content=81721&type=learning_material_item
